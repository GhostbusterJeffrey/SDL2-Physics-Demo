# SDL2 C++ Physics Demo
Written by me, this is a simple C++ SDL2 program to demonstrate physics on a cube. Hold A or D to control direction, and press space to jump.

## Compiling
Download the main.cpp file and the Makefile. In your project folder, make sure to add the latest SDL2.dll file. Also, don't forget to edit the paths in the Makefile to match your install of SDL2 correspondingly. Then, simply run:
**make**
from your command line. Keep in mind that the Makefile has been written to run on Windows and may need to be modified to compile to other operating systems such as Linux or MacOS.
